      <p>
        ChatGPT is built using the transformer architecture and is trained on a
        large corpus of text data. It uses a combination of self-attention
        mechanisms and fully connected layers to generate text based on the
        input provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you provide input to the model, it uses its internal state to
        generate a prediction for the next word in the sequence, based on the
        context provided so far. This process is repeated until the desired
        length of text is generated or until a termination token is generated by
        the model.
